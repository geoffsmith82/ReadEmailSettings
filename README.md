# ReadEmailSettings
The project contains code from one of my projects that I wrote nearly 20 years ago.  Most of the code is reading Microsoft Outlook settings from the registry.  The main purpose I use this project for is to read the Blocked Senders in my Outlook 2010 and upload those addresses to a ISPConfig database to Block those addresses on the server.
